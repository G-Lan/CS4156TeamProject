UCL-0gAth4u6Wp-9_98XU3nA	"The Official YouTube Page for fingerstyle guitarist - Tommy Emmanuel, CGP.

Tommy Emmanuel has achieved enough musical milestones to satisfy several lifetimes. At the age of six, he was touring regional Australia with his family band. By 30, he was a rock n’ roll lead guitarist burning up stadiums in Europe. At 44, he became one of five people ever named a Certified Guitar Player (or CGP) by his idol, music icon Chet Atkins. Today, he plays hundreds of sold-out shows every year from Nashville to Sydney to London. Since he and his brother Phil taught themselves to play as toddlers, the guitar has been Tommy’s real first language–and he’s more articulate on his signature Melbourne-made Maton acoustics than most people are with words. Influenced by the Merle Travis/Chet Atkins fingerstyle of guitar picking, Tommy developed a style of solo guitar playing that encompasses the range of a whole band– covering drums, bass, rhythm and lead guitar and a vocal melody simultaneously.

Over the course of two full-length albums, it's true that the villainous, murderous match-strikers and revenge-takers outnumber those with good intentions, but in the end, no heinous act goes unpunished.

The Dead South, a gold rush vibing four-piece acoustic bluegrass set from Saskatchewan, infuse the genre's traditional trappings with an air of frontier recklessness, whiskey breakfasts and grizzled tin-pan showmanship. Their original and current lineup includes the gnarled baritone of Nate Hilts, Scott Pringle on mandolin, whistling cellist Danny Kenyon and virtuosic banjo player Colton Crawford. The four-piece, acoustic string-driven approach puts the interplay of unique and versatile voices front and centre, with Hilts, Pringle and Kenyon all sharing lead vocal duties."

The band's membership has had at least a dozen changes over the years, including a period from 1976 to 1981 when the band performed and recorded as the Dirt Band.

Of course there is nothing wrong with those genres of music, but I really wanted to teach Jazz so I started writing some lessons on my website. After publishing a few on Ultimate Guitar, I was adviced by Chris Zoupa to start making YouTube videos (if you like the videos you should really Thank him). As you can see that turned out to be a lot of fun!"

The four-time Emmy Award-winning musical competition series ""The Voice"" returns with the strongest vocalists from across the country to compete in the show's newest season. Rock icon and pop culture phenomenon Gwen Stefani reclaims her red chair alongside superstar coaches Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Blake Shelton for Season 19. Carson Daly returns as host.

The show's innovative format features four stages of competition: the Blind Auditions, the Battle Rounds, Knockouts, and the Live Performance Shows.

During the Blind Auditions, the decisions from the musician coaches are based solely on voice and not looks. If a coach is impressed by the artist's voice, he/she pushes a button to select the artist for his/her team.

The singers with the lowest number of votes will be sent home each week. In the end, one will be named ""The Voice"" and will receive the grand prize of a recording contract.

Combined sales of 5SOS’s first two albums now exceed six million units worldwide. Having already sold over 1 million concert tickets around the globe, in 2016 the band played 101 sold-out arena shows at some of the world's biggest venues.

The band’s latest album ‘Youngblood’, went straight to the top spot of the Billboard 200 when released in June 2018 and has to date sold over 1 million copies. ‘Youngblood’ – the album’s title song – quickly became a global smash hit, with cumulative sales already surpassing 3.5 million.

From track to track, OneRepublic—which features lead singer/songwriter Ryan Tedder, bassist Brent Kutzle, guitarists Zach Filkins and Drew Brown, and drummer Eddie Fisher—parallel the extraordinary scope of the album’s creation by blending alt-rock, gospel, synth-pop, nu-disco, and folk. With its abundance of sweeping, stadium-ready anthems, Oh My My shapes those eclectic elements into songs built on both masterfully expansive arrangements and bravely intimate lyrics.
 
A Grammy Award-winning songwriter and producer who’s worked with the likes of Adele, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, and U2, Tedder co-produced Oh My My along with Kutzle, Noel Zancanella (Ellie Goulding, Maroon 5, Ariana Grande), and Benny Blanco (Passion Pit, Charli XCX, Rihanna)."

UCHPbrkmgqJpoKaGxrUmbMvA	"Что такое «Сваты»?
Это не только семьдесят четыре серии, спрессованные в шесть сезонов. Это более двух тысяч страниц сценарного текста. Это 403 съемочных дня -- рабочих смен по 12-15 часов каждая. Это пятилетний труд 15 сценаристов, 68 актеров, занятых в ролях, 102 актеров, занятых в эпизодах и более 200 актеров массовых сцен. «Сваты» - это месяцы монтажа, сотни костюмов и килограммы грима. Это пятилетний труд большого коллектива, спаявшегося в команду. И, разумеется, своя уникальная история.

Первый фильм «Сваты» появился на экранах еще в 2008 году. С тех пор сериал приобрел миллионы поклонников. Показ фильма на украинском телевидении имел беспрецедентный успех, получив рекордно высокие рейтинги. Третью, четвертую и пятую части «Сватов» посмотрела треть украинских семей!
«Сваты» неоднократно становились лауреатами самых престижных украинских телевизионных премий."

Adventure to me is sleeping in a bamboo hut on stilts without any running water or electricity.  Adventure travel to me is biking on a 6″ wide levy between two disgusting fish ponds in Vietnam knowing that if I lose my balance, its all over.  Adventure to me is hiking hut to hut in the breathtaking Swiss Alps.  Adventure to me is waking up in the morning in the Amazon only then realizing that my room is missing one entire wall that is open to the jungle.  Exercise is a huge part of my travel adventure.  Not only as a method of locomotion but as a way to really get a feel for the country.  Many might consider going to a gym on vacation a “waste of time”, but to me, not only is a just a part of my lifestyle but its a way to meet locals.

Food and the events that manifest around it are one of the everlasting experiences that cannot be replicated by arcs and zeroes. MUNCHIES chronicles the wide spectrum of the global culinary experience and the diverse voices that are pulling us forward: chefs and home cooks, makers and consumers, the politics and policies of food, ""front"" and ""back of house"" restaurant life, old wives tales and innovative news, and culturally significant indicators in our modern world. Through engaging original video content, compelling editorial features, articles, how-tos, recipes and events, MUNCHIES offers a signature perspective on the intersection where humans and food connect."

I am an obsessed DIYer and Woodworker. I'm not professional or have any training, so I just pick the project I want to tackle and figure it out step by step. 

I picked up my first tool in January of 2013. I couldn't afford to buy the things I wanted around my home, so I decided to try my hand at making them instead. I was hooked after my first project so I just never stopped. 

I put out a video as well as a written tutorial on all the projects I do to improve my home and workshop. You can find my website at Wilkerdos.com

If you would like to SEND OUR ANIMALS stuff (a card, dog toys, cat toys, beds, rescue equipment or a check donation), it would be amazing!!!  They LOVE it!!!

Our address:
Hope For Paws
8950 W. Olympic Blvd #525
Los Angeles, CA 90211

We couldn't do this work without your support!  Please join us as a monthly donor of $5 and help us save many more lives this year: https://www.HopeForPaws.org

The less time we have to spend on fundraising for these animals, the more time we have to actually go out there and get them off the streets.  Veterinary care is extremely expensive, and you are making it all possible when you support our efforts!   If you haven't done so yet, I hope you will join us today.

Please follow our social media for regular updates on rescues & adoptions.

Being completely independent, the boys don't have to answer to anyone except their own creative spirit and their focus is on quality over quantity. 
It doesn't matter if you have a brand new turbo charged beast, or an old banger found in your grandfathers shed. Mighty Car Mods openly embraces anyone who wants to better themselves and their cars through involvement with the MCM Community."
